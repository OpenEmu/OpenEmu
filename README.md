Open Emu is an open source project to bring game emulation to OS X as a first class citizen, leveraging modern OS X technologies such as Cocoa, Core Animation and Quartz, and 3rd party libraries like Sparkle for auto-updating. Open Emu is based on a modular architecture, allowing for game-engine plugins, this means Open Emu can support a host of different emulation engines and back-ends while retaining a familiar OS X native front-end. 

Currently Open Emu can load the following game engines as plugins:

* CrabEmu  - adds support for Sega Master System, Game Gear, SG - 1000
* Gambatte  - adds support for Game Boy and Game Boy Color
* Genesis Plus - adds support for Sega Genesis, Sega CD and Sega 32x
* Nestopia - adds support for NES/Famicom
* SNES9x - adds support for SNES and Super Famicom
* BSNES - adds support for SNES and Super Famicom
* Visualboy Advance - adds support for Game Boy Advance

Open Emu also supports high quality scaling with Open GL, multi-threaded video and audio playback as well as individual features and preferences per game engine, such as NTSC video signal emulation for the Nestopia core.
