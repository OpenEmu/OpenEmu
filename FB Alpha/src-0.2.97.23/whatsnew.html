<h3>v0.2.97.12</h3>
<p><b>Note:</b> This version has some changes to the Megadrive driver. The driver is now based on the MESS software list.</p>
<p>The game shortnames are prepended by <i>md_</i> to differentiate them from the arcade games where conflicts occur. FB Alpha will look for your roms in the normal zip names, you do <b>not</b> need to create a new copy of the games and prepend <i>md_</i>. It is advisable to have the Megadrive roms in the seventh or eighth rom paths to avoid conflicts with arcade games. Support files will need to retain the <i>md_</i> in order to avoid conflicts, however.</p>
<p>All Megadrive games are now enabled (except for Virtua Racing because the SVP isn't emulated), most should work, however, some may not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Megadrive Changes</li><ul>
<li>Updated Megadrive driver based on MESS 0.143u7 software list [Barry]</li>

<h3>v0.2.97.06</h3>
<p>This version includes a big change in the Z80 CPU interface. Specifically MAME's Z80 core is now used for all games. This should give better results and make the program more portable. We have done a lot of testing but if you notice any new problems please let us know and we can fix them.</p>
<p>This version also includes changes in the EEPROM code and input assignment code. As well as the changed save states for the ZET interface, these render old config and save files pretty much useless. <b>It is advised to delete the contents of the <i>config\games</i> folder before using this version</b>. Savestates are a bit hit-and-miss at the moment anyway. I plan to pay some attention to savestates in the next version and hopefully boost compatibility.</p>

<div class="note">From this point forward, all releases are handled by Barry and each external contribution is labelled.<br /><br />The releases below were available on the old FBA site.</div>

<h3>v0.2.95.23</h3>
<p>Time for another FinalBurn Alpha release, bringing with it an assortment of fixes and additions. Grab it while its hot, from our files page. Any bugs / issues should be reported to the FBA official forums.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is still an alpha release!</li>
<li>Note that, if compiled with GCC, you will need to use version 3.3.x, and the experimental DirectX 9 blitter is not built</li>
<li>Changed the way FB Alpha looks for ROMs. Now, it will always check the last path for any given .zip file, even when a .zip file of the same name is present in another path. This way, we can keep ROMs that are only needed for FB Alpha seperate without sacrifising compatibility with other emulators</li>
<li>Changed the way Neo Geo memory cards work, allowing the use of 1 megabit cards</li>
<li>Emulated protection in Super Sidekicks (was patched before)</li>
<li>Fixed the last few bad game names / bad ROM definitions</li>

<ul>
<li>This is still an alpha release!</li>
<li>Note that, if compiled with GCC, you will need to use version 3.3.x, and the experimental DirectX 9 blitter is not built</li>

</ul>

<h3>v0.129</h3>
