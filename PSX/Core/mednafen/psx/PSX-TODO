Soul Reaver - Legacy of Kain has CD load time pauses where it probably shouldn't.

Battle Arena Toshinden, Final Fantasy 7 have some kind of GPU timing issues.

Zero Divide runs too fast(related to CPU emulation speed?).

Chrono Cross has several-second freezes during some large special attack/magic sequences.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Tiny Toon Adventures - Plucky's Big Adventure is failing and BREAK'ing for some reason, maybe memcard related.

Shadow Master might have broken startup images.

Crusaders of Might and Magic - The CD-XA buffering increase for ToD II is apparently exacerbating the early voice cutoff problem in this game.

Crash Team Racing - Noticed a game lockup once in the arcade mode stage select screen, having trouble reproducing it.

Test time delta between GPU LL DMA end and GPU non-busy status for various primitive types in sequence on a PS1.

Test IRQ and COP0 latencies; PSX IRQ controller latency, software IRQ bit latency, latency of both relevant COP0 IRQ enable bits.

Test IRQ with LWC2.

Test IRQ with COP0 instructions(interrupted execution or not?).

Determine maximum quad height and width.  See if drawing is an all-or-nothing thing, or if one triangle of the pair will still be drawn
if it's not too large.

Test 0x0 and 1x1 polygon throughput for all triangle and quad drawing commands.

Fix line drawing algorithm to match test results on the real thing.

Instruction cache emulation(MAYBE).


Test time between voice on and envelope reset; test time between voice on and first ADPCM block memory fetch.

The SPU in the PS1 might sometimes drop voice on events when playing an ADPCM block that loops to itself(and was also the first and only
ADPCM block, at least in the test program I noticed the issue in); investigate further.



Make sure debugger COPn disassembly is correct(no typos or whatnot).
