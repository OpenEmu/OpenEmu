Battle Arena Toshinden and Zero Divide runs too fast(related to CPU or GPU emulation speed?).

Tiny Toon Adventures - Plucky's Big Adventure is failing and BREAK'ing for some reason during startup, probably because the emulated CPU
is running too fast.

Resident Evil 2 - Lockup on second disc in a certain place; probably related to seek timing.

Tomb Raider(PAL) - (reported, not personally investigated yet) "was fighting Tomb Raider PAL this night, when you get out of pool in Lara's home the game bugs out: issues GetlocP, waits for it to complete and expects seek to be NOT complete (i.e. older location)"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shadow Master might have broken startup images.

Crusaders of Might and Magic - The CD-XA buffering increase for ToD II is apparently exacerbating the early voice cutoff problem in this game.

Crash Team Racing - Noticed a game lockup once in the arcade mode stage select screen, having trouble reproducing it.

WipeOut 3 - Music stops playing after a long while(maybe it's supposed to do that?).

Nightmare Creatures - BIOS reverb sound excessively contaminates beginning of game; emulating CD "Reset" command timing more
accurately might fix it.

Eldergate - Screen garbage after "world creation", disappears if town is entered; might be caused by CD reading or
seeking being too fast?

Investigate CD-XA FIR filter on a PS1, for 4-bit and 8-bit modes, and both playback rates.  Might be difficult without a modchip,
though...

Respect device(GPU, SPU, etc.) DMA mode/memory access mode bits(more for homebrew's sake than commercial games'). 

Test if Dual Analog vibration compatibility mode can be restored with DualShock after using DualShock extended features if the "Analog"
mode button on the gamepad is pressed after the extended features are used.

Test time delta between GPU LL DMA end and GPU non-busy status for various primitive types in sequence on a PS1.

Test IRQ and COP0 latencies; PSX IRQ controller latency, software IRQ bit latency, latency of both relevant COP0 IRQ enable bits.

Test IRQ with LWC2.

Test IRQ with COP0 instructions(interrupted execution or not?).

Determine maximum quad height and width.  See if drawing is an all-or-nothing thing, or if one triangle of the pair will still be drawn
if it's not too large.

Test 0x0 and 1x1 polygon throughput for all triangle and quad drawing commands.

Fix line drawing algorithm to match test results on the real thing.

Instruction cache emulation(MAYBE).


Test time between voice on and envelope reset; test time between voice on and first ADPCM block memory fetch.

The SPU in the PS1 might sometimes drop voice on events when playing an ADPCM block that loops to itself(and was also the first and only
ADPCM block, at least in the test program I noticed the issue in); investigate further.



Make sure debugger COPn disassembly is correct(no typos or whatnot).
