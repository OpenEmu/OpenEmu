		<h2>Technical Information</h2>
		<h3>What's Emulated?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>65c816 main CPU.</li>
			<li>Variable length machine cycles.</li>
			<li>8 channel DMA and H-DMA.</li>
			<li>H-IRQ, V-IRQ and NMI.</li>
			<li>Sony SPC700 sound CPU.</li>
			<li>Sound DSP, with eight 16-bit, stereo channels, compressed samples, hardware envelope processing, echo, pitch modulation and digital FIR sound filter.</li>
			<li>SRAM, a battery-backed RAM.</li>
			<li>All background modes, 0 to 7.</li>
			<li>All screen resolutions including interlace mode.</li>
			<li>Pseudo hi-res mode.</li>
			<li>8x8, 16x8 and 16x16 tile sizes, flipped in either direction.</li>
			<li>32x32, 32x64, 64x32 and 64x64 screen tile sizes.</li>
			<li>Vertical and horizontal offset-per-tile.</li>
			<li>128 8x8, 16x16, 32x32 and 64x64 sprites, flipped in either direction.</li>
			<li>Sub-screen and fixed color blending effects.</li>
			<li>Mosaic effects.</li>
			<li>Mode 7 screen rotation, scaling and screen flipping.</li>
			<li>Single and dual graphic clip windows, with all four logic combination modes.</li>
			<li>Color blending effects only inside or outside a window.</li>
			<li>Palette changes during frame.</li>
			<li>Direct color mode - uses tile and palette-group data directly as RGB value.</li>
			<li>SNES Mouse.</li>
			<li>Super Scope, emulated using computer mouse.</li>
			<li>Justifier, by Konami, similar to the Super Scope and used only in Lethal Enforcers.</li>
			<li>Multi Player 5, allowing up to five people to play games simultaneously on games that support that many players.</li>
			<li>Super FX, a fast RISC CPU used in several games.</li>
			<li>SA-1, a faster version of main CPU with some functions, used in several games.</li>
			<li>DSP-1, a custom chip used in several games, mainly racing games.</li>
			<li>DSP-2, a custom chip used only in Dungeon Master.</li>
			<li>DSP-4, a custom chip used only in Top Gear 3000.</li>
			<li>C4, a sprite scaler/rotator/line drawer/simple maths co-processor chip used only in Megaman X2 and X3.</li>
			<li>Seta-10, a custom chip used only in F1 Race of Champions 2.</li>
			<li>OBC1, a sprite management chip used only in Metal Combat.</li>
			<li>S-DD1, a data decompression chip used only in Star Ocean and Street Fighter 2 Alpha.</li>
			<li>SPC7110, similar in use to S-DD1, used in a few Hadoson games.</li>
			<li>S-RTC, a real-time clock chip, used only in Dai Kaijyu Monogatari 2.</li>
			<li>Satellaview and BS-X, only partially.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What's Not?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Exact sub-cycle timings of communication among most of parts - main CPU, sound CPU, DMA, H-DMA, IRQ, NMI, and so on. Snes9x cannot run games that require severe timings!</li>
			<li>Any other odd chips that manufactures sometimes placed inside the cartridge to enhance games and as a nice side-effect, also act as an anti-piracy measure. (DSP-3, Seta-11 and Seta-18, as examples)</li>
			<li>The expansion slot found in many carts.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Custom Chips</h3>
		<h4>Super FX</h4>
		<p>
			The Super FX is a 10.5/21MHz RISC CPU developed by Argonaut Software used as a game enhancer by several game titles. Released SNES Super FX games included Yoshi's Island, Doom, Winter Gold, Dirt Trax FX, StarFox, Stunt Race FX and Vortex.
		</p>
		<h4>SA-1</h4>
		<p>
			The SA-1 is a fast, custom 65c816 8/16-bit processor, the same as inside the SNES itself, but clocked at 10MHz compared to a maximum of 3.58MHz for the CPU inside the SNES. The SA-1 isn't just a CPU; it also contains some extra circuits developed by Nintendo which includes some very fast RAM, a memory mapper, DMA and, several real-time timers.
		</p>
		<h4>C4</h4>
		<p>
			The C4 is custom Capcom chip used only in the Megaman X2 and Megaman X3 games. It can scale and rotate images, draw line-vector objects and do some simple maths to rotate them.
		</p>
		<h4>S-DD1</h4>
		<p>
			The S-DD1 is a custom data decompression chip that can decompress data in real-time as the SNES DMA's data from the ROM to RAM. Only two games use the chip: Star Ocean and Street Fighter Alpha 2.
		</p>
		<h4>SPC7110</h4>
		<p>
			The SPC7110 is a compression and memory mapping chip. It provides a few extra features as well. It functions as an RTC interface, and has a multiply/divide unit that has more precision than the SNES. The SPC7110 is found only in 4 games: Super Power League 4, Far East of Eden Zero, Far East of Eden Zero - Shounen Jump no Shou and Momotaro Dentetsu Happy.
		</p>
		<h4>Others</h4>
		<p>
			Other known custom chips: DSP-1, DSP-2, DSP-3, DSP-4, Seta-10, Seta-11, Seta-18, OBC1 and S-RTC.
