		<h2>Peripherals Support</h2>
		<h3>Satellaview</h3>
		<p>
			Snes9x partially emulates Satellaview system, so-called BS-X. To play BS games or read BS magazines with the BS-X base cartridge, do the following.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you have .srm files of BS games which were created by Snes9x 1.43 or earlier, trash them first.</li>
			<li>Prepare the BS-X ROM image. Make sure the file is uncompressed and doesn't have a header.</li>
			<li>Rename the BS-X ROM image to 'BS-X.bin'.</li>
			<li>Put BS-X.bin in the proper directory. 'BIOSes' folder by default.</li>
			<li>Launch BS-X.bin as you usually play SNES games.</li>
			<li>Set your name and gender.</li>
			<li>Launch a BS game. The game is launched for the first time and its .srm doesn't exist, so BS-X.srm is loaded instead.</li>
			<li>Once you launched the game, its .srm is created and loaded from the next time.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If you launch a BS game for the first time without BS-X.srm, maybe the game doesn't work properly.<br>
			To boot up BS games from BS-X town, turn on 'Boot Up BS Games from BS-X' option in 'Preferences' dialog.
		</p>
		<h3>Sufami Turbo</h3>
		<p>
			To play Sufami Turbo games, do the following.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Prepare the Sufami Turbo base cartridge ROM image. Make sure the file is uncompressed and doesn't have a header.</li>
			<li>Rename the base cartridge ROM image to 'STBIOS.bin'.</li>
			<li>Put STBIOS.bin in the proper directory. 'BIOSes' folder by default.</li>
			<li>Choose 'Open Multiple ROM Images...' from 'File' menu.</li>
			<li>Set game(s) into each slot with 'Choose...', 'Clear' and 'Swap' buttons. You can also drag and drop the ROM image onto each slot.</li>
			<li>Press 'OK' button and the Sufami Turbo system will run.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note that the base cartridge can initialize SRAM for only the game in slot A, so you have to set every game in slot A and launch at least once.<br>
			If no games are set in the slots, only the base cartridge runs.<br>
			If you have a combined ROM image, split it to each games and the base cartridge. NSRT will help you.
		</p>
		<h3>Other Multiple Cartridge Games</h3>
		<p>
			In 'Open Multiple ROM Images' dialog, put the main cartridge in slot A and the add-on cartridge in slot B.<br>
			Currently supported: Same Game
