
 Changes:

 - Added config, blur, sealintf modules to DOS code.
 - Fixed playfield height bug.
   Corrects misplaced raster effects in many games.
 - Added '-split', '-flip', '-usa' options to config.c and dos.c
 - Implemented RB's changes to the PSG channel generation.
 - Changed sound output to work based on the DOS sound enable
   rather than the emulated sound enable, so sound can be generated
   even if not output to the sound card. (for wave logging, etc)
 - Added wave module to DOS code.
 - Changed shared.h so types.h was read before osd.h, needed
   by the typedefs used in wave.h
 - Updated id.c and included game resource list for 416 images.
   This provides auto flip and split options for loaded games.
   Note that this fails for improperly named games, one example is
   that Veigues Tactical Gladiator (J) is 384K, and the (U) version
   is not flagged as having a 512K size.
 - Added clipping to render_obj() for sprites out of the X range.
   (Magical Chase)
 - Simplified double-width sprite rendering.
 - Removed 'offset' member from t_bitmap.
 - Added 16-bit versions of the rendering routines.
 - Modified center_x/y in dos.c to be updated when the viewport changes.
 - Moved VRAM to VRAM transfer code out of vdc_w() and into it's own
   function, as well as adding proper support for source and destination
   overlapping and address inrement/decrement.
   Added #define to log DMA transfers for debugging.
 - Cleaned up some of the register handling (e.g. BYR) in vdc_w().
 - Added help text printing option.
 - Added wave filename parameter to -wave option and added default
   filename use ("pce.wav") if no name is given.
 - Added blur option and mapped it to key F9. For 16-bit color only.
 - Fixed color #0 handling for 16-bit displays.
 - Added message system, throttling, and FPS meter options to DOS code.
 - The IRQ1 line is cleared when the VDC status flags are read.
 - The vblank flag is set when a vblank interrupt occurs.
   (so it monitors the interrupt and not the vblank period itself)
 - The vblank interrupt now occurs on line 240 instead of 242.
 - The sprite DMA transfer flag is only updated when an interrupt will occur.
   (so it monitors the interrupt and not the DMA completion itself)
 - Changed -wave argument checking as not to accept a NULL filename.

 * Note: Sent code to porters.

 - Added support to the T flag by extending the functionality of
   the SET instruction; doesn't seem to work, though the Legendary Axe II
   title screen now has somewhat improved sprite graphics on the sword icon.
   (Doesn't fix Bravoman, may have made original Legendary Axe worse)
 - Added sprite precalculation to take advantage of the single frame
   sprite RAM updates. Simplified the sprite rendering code quite a bit.
 - Ensured the Y offset was wrapped when BYR was updated.
   (Didn't seem to fix bad wipe-in effect in PC Genjin 2)
 - Added full support for 8 and 16-bit rendering.
 - Modified t_sprite structure to have signed Y values - fixes incoming
   sprites at top of display.
 - Made endian fixes to VCE code.
 - Removed 'line' structure from t_bitmap, added 'granularity'.
 - Fixed scanlines code in dos.c.
 - Fixed 16-bit line clearing in render.c
 - Fixed all references to bitmap data in render.c and dos.c
 - Removed unused stuff from cpuintrf.h
 - Removed unused stuff from h6280.c
 - Added check_zip to verify ZIP archives in a portable manner.
 - Removed debug messages from h6280ops.c
 - Commented out debug messages from pce.c, system.c, vdc.c
 - Removed save_file() calls in pce.c
 - Changed DOS code to not call PSG emulation when sound is disabled.
 - Added CPU emulator to makefile.
 - Added FAST_MEM switch for faster memory access.
 - Added SuperGrafx RAM back in so Aldynes and others work.
 - Rewrote pattern caching for speed.
 - Fixed FAST_MEM routines to prevent ROM writes. (fixes Night Creatures)
 - Modified background pattern caching to use pixel > bitplane lookup tables.
 - Modified make_sprite_list() so only used sprites are looked at.
 - Modified VCE code to respond to unique data writes only.
 - Compiling with FAST_MEM replaces cpu_writeport16() with vdc_w().
 - Moved prototypes for cpu_* functions into h6280.h

 * Note: Sent code to porters.

 - Modified cpu_writemem21_fast in h6280ops.h so it compiles correctly.
 - Removed uncessary check from the object render functions.
 - Added sprite list to render_obj_16, and removed a positioning hack.
 - Changed make_332_palette() for more vibrant colors.
 - Removed LSB_FIRST checks in render.c, except for when making the
   bp_lut table data.
 - Changed DVSSR trigger to be set when the MSB of reg. 0x13 is written.
 - Sped-up BG pattern caching by indexing the bitplane lookup table
   with two word-wide indexes instead of four byte-wide ones.
 - Moved blitting into dos_update_video();
 - Added vsync polling option.
 - Added proper text color setup for 8 and 16-bit rendering.
 - Added FPS meter, vsync, speed throttle toggle keys.
 - Added BRAM save/load to pce.c
 - Fixed frameskip option. (system_frame() really skips now)
 - Cleaned up debugging code and error logging.
 - Fixed screen snapshot code.
 - Fixed DOS joystick polling and default state.
 - BRAM is now saved if the unlock register ($1807) is written to.
 - Added automatic resolution switching to dos.c and config.c

 * Note: Sent code to porters.

 - Changed system_init() call to enable sound if wave logging is enabled.
 - Added Macintosh specific hack to render_reset() for depth changing.
 - Changed bitmap structure to have the previous unique viewport size.
 - Removed some old code from the screenshot creation routine.
 - Added support for GZ compressed files in fileio.c
 - Fixed frame skip configuring via the command line option.
 - Rewrote the PSG sound emulation.
 - Fixed snapshot code to ignore cases when the display is 0x0.
 - Changed bitmap viewport init code to give initial size of 256x240.
