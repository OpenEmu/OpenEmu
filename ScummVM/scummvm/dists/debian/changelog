    emulation library being present in the buildd chroots. ScummVM
    itself builds fine with OSS support (Closes: #600655)

      - Add a dependency on libfluidsynth-dev, as the new upstream release can
        make use of the fluidsynth library directly.

 -- Tore Anderson <tore@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Jul 2005 11:38:18 +0200

scummvm (0.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  * configure:
      - Reverted to the upstream version, as the GCC 4.0 patch from 0.7.0-3 is
        now included there.

      - Remove superfluous "the" from the description.

        using GCC 4.0.  GCC 4.0 is not yet supported from upstream, though.

        maintaining a separate list of authors there.

  * debian/scummvm.dirs, debian/rules, debian/scummvm.sh (removed):
      - A more sane default save game path has been chosen upstream.  Remove
        the Debian-specific wrapper script workaround introduced in 0.6.0-2

      - Make /usr/games/scummvm be a wrapper script which creates the
        ~/.scummvmrc file if it doesn't already exist, setting the savegame
        path to ~/.scummvm/.  Closes: #216178.  This is a workaround, though,
        I really wish this would be fixed in the upstream sources.

  * debian/control:
      - Correct the compability chart link in the package description.
      - Update package description so it is clear that Flight of The Amazon
        Queen and Beneath a Steel Sky is available in Debian, closes: #245356.

  * debian/README.Debian (removed):
      - Removed from the package, as it only spoke of the ScummVM tools,
        which was removed in the 0.6.0-1 upload.  Closes: #259259 (sort-of).

  * base/main.cpp, scumm/actor.cpp, scumm/debugger.cpp:

      - Remove the various tools as they really don't belong in the ScummVM
