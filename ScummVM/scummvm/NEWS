        https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/commits/

1.6.0 (????-??-??)
 General:
   - Added a new save/load chooser based on a grid of thumbnails. This is only
     supported for resolutions bigger than 640x400. The old chooser is still
     available and used for games without thumbnail support. It is possible to
     select the old one as default too.
   - Rewrote VideoDecoder subsystem.
   - Added Galician translation.

  Cine:
   - Improved audio support for Amiga and AtariST versions of Future Wars.
     Now music fades out slowly instead of stopping immediately. Sound
     effects are now properly panned, when requested by the game.

  Dreamweb:
   - Now that the game is freeware, there is a small extra help text showing
     the available commands in the in-game terminals when the player uses the
     'help' command. Previously, players needed to consult the manual for the
     available commands. Since this reference to the manual is a form of copy
     protection, this extra line can be toggled by the ScummVM copy protection
     command line option.

  SCUMM:
   - Implemented Monkey Island 2 Macintosh's audio driver. Now we properly
     support its sample based audio output. The same output is also used for
     the m68k Macintosh version of Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.

     ports take advantage of this.
   - Added Basque translation.
   - Added custom game and engine options in the AGI, DREAMWEB, KYRA, QUEEN,
     SKY and SCI engines. It is now possible to toggle these options via the
