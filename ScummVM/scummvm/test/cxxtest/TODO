This is an -*- Outline -*- of ideas for future versions of CxxTest.
It is not meant to be "human readable".

* CxxTest To Do list

** Mock framework

Write some mocks

*** Distribution
Seperate packages (w/ binaries)?  How would that be used?
For Windows: .lib for "Real" and "Mock" parts.
For Linux: Maybe. Different compilers etc.
So probably only source release with Makefiles and .ds[pw]?  Or just Win32 binary.

**** Installation?
extract cxxtest-x.y.z.tar.gz
(extract cxxtest-mock-x.y.z.tar.gz) ?
make -C cxxtest/Real
make -C cxxtest/Mock

or maybe make -C cxxtest -f Makefile.mock
but then Makefile.mock.bcc32, Makefile.mock.msvc, Makefile.mock.gcc, and heaven knows what else.

Could put the Makefile.mock.* in cxxtest/Real and cxxtest/Mock or in cxxtest/T

Maybe this should be a different package altogether?
Seems logical, since they evolve separately.  But then you'd want to download both.

** Thoughts
-fomit-frame-pointer

** TS_HEX
