Compiling ScummVM for SEGA Dreamcast
====================================

If you want to compile ScummVM for your Dreamcast,
you'll need the following:

* gcc-3.4.2 configured as a cross-compiler for `sh-elf'

* binutils-2.18 configured likewise

* newlib for sh-elf : <URL:http://mc.pp.se/dc/files/newlib-1.12.0.tar.gz>

* libronin-0.5 : <URL:http://peter.bortas.org/scumm/libronin-0.5.tar.gz>

* libmad : <URL:http://mc.pp.se/dc/files/libmad-0.15.1b.tar.gz>

* GNU make


Edit the Makefile to contain the path to libronin if you installed it
somewhere other than /usr/local/ronin, then run `make dist', and you
should get a scrambled binary SCUMMVM.BIN and some plugins *.PLG.

For serial/IP upload, remove the "DYNAMIC_MODULES" line and just run `make',
to get a static binary with the name `scummvm.elf'.
