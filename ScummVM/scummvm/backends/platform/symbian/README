About ScummVM
--------------
	The original ports (uptil 0.7.1) were made by Andreas Karlsson and Lars Persson.
	The main transition to 0.8.0CVS and all relevant changes were done by Jurgen Braam.
	Jurgen and Lars have successfully transfered all needed changes into CVS/SVN, with additional helpful tools for Symbian OS

	* SVN builds (not frequently updated) can be found at http://www.anotherguest.se


Games supported
---------------
	The Symbian port of ScummVM supports all games. Some games might not run properly due to screenresolution or memory constraints.
	Minimum free memory requirement is about 12MB to be able to start and run ScummVM, this is enough for most older games, but newer more resource hungry games, might require more.

Building ScummVM
---------------------

	Nescessary components
	---------------------
	Building ScummVM yourself using the UIQ 2.1/Nokia S60 SDK/Nokia S80 SDK/Nokia S90 SDK framework is not an easy task!
	Lets just say the framework needs quite some time to set up and takes a while
	to get used to. If you choose to continue you will need the following items:

	- UIQ 3.x SDK (To build for UIQ3 devices)(Build scripts in SDK need tweaking in order to build scummvm since Symbian OS GCCE never builds as large projects as ScummVM before)
	- UIQ 2.1 SDK (To build for UIQ2 devices);
	  http://www.symbian.com/developer/sdks_uiq.asp

	- Nokia S60 1st, 2nd edition,3rd edition SDK (To build for S60 devices)

	- Nokia S80 SDK (To build for S80 devices)

	- Nokia 7710 SDK (To build for the 7710/S90 device)

	- ECompXL, an EPOC application compression library
	  http://www.yipton.demon.co.uk/ecompxl/latest/readme.html (To build for UIQ devices)

	- libsdl, Simple Directmedia Layer, a cross-platform multimedia library
	  http://www.libsdl.org/ (see note about ESDL below)

	- libmad, a high-quality MPEG audio decoder
	  http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/

	- zlib, a massively spiffy yet delicately unobtrusive compression library
	  http://www.zlib.net/
	- latest version of active perl (included with Symbian SDK does not work with the build scripts)

	- libogg, the free media file container format
	  http://www.xiph.org/ogg/

	- libvorbis, the free audio codec
	  http://www.vorbis.com/
	These are probably too heavy-duty for your phone:

	- flac, the Free Lossless Audio Codec
	  http://flac.sourceforge.net/

	Compiling ScummVM
	-----------------

	ECompXL (Only needed for UIQ2):
	this is a tool that will compress your executable with GZIP and glue
	it to a predefined loader app. The app will uncompress your application at
	runtime and run it without you even knowing it. A really interesting byproduct
	of this method is that the general restriction of not having any writeable
	static data (WSD) for Symbian APP executables no longer applies. This makes
	the life of an EPOC porter a lot easier! To install this tool you need to add
	its \bin path to your PATH above the sybmian epocs32\tools path, so that ECompXL's
	PETRAN.EXE will be the executable that is started.


	SDL: the latest version of SDL at this point in time is 1.2.13. This version
	works great for compiling on other platforms.

	zlib: the zlib-x.x.x.tar.gz does not come with UIQ .mpp build files, that's why
	I added them for you in epoc-zlib.zip. Extract in <DevRoot>/zlib/ which will
	create the epoc dir. In <DevRoot>/zlib/epoc/ go:
	> bldmake bldfiles
	> abld build

	libmad: the libmad-x.x.x.tar.gz does not come with UIQ .mpp build files, that's
	why I added them for you in epoc-libmad.zip. Extract in <DevRoot>/libmad/ which
	will create the epoc dir. In <DevRoot>/libmad/epoc/ go:
	> bldmake bldfiles
	> abld build

	ScummVM:
	In <DevRoot>\scummvm\backends\platform\symbian\ go:
	a) Edit and update the BuildPackageUpload_LocalSettings.pl for the kind of build (SDK installed etc) and variants
	   you want to build.
      b) Run BuildPackageUpload_AllVersions.pl to build all the targets/variants that you have configured.
	   A detailed log will be placed in the symbian folder with Build.err.log and Build.out.log but it also depends on
	   the configuration you select.

	Now you should have yourself a nice ScummVM_xxx.sis installer package in the packages folder for use
	on your phone. Please note that for development it will be a lot faster if you
	transfer the SCUMMVM.APP/Scummvm.EXE file directly to your !:\system\apps\ScummVM\ dir!

	Platforms can be one of: ARMi, ARM4, THUMB, WINS, WINSCW, GCCE. The SE P900 uses the ARMi platform,
	which is a combined ARM4/THUMB programming mode. Configurations can be one of:
	UREL or UDEB.


Greetz & such
-------------
	Kudos fly out to:
	- Sprawl for having the nerve to start & carry this puppy for so long
	- AnotherGuest for having the nerve to start & carry this puppy for so long
	- Fingolfin for taking the time to go through 1000 patch versions with me
	- Myself (SumthinWicked), for writing this entire README and adopting all sources together with Fingolfin :)
	- the entire ScummVM Dev team for making a kicka$$ program
	- the folks in #scummvm @ irc.freenode.net for their help, confort and support
	- everybody else who wants to give me 'the look' for not including them here :P


	it's been swell,
	gotta go now,

	greetz,
