Virtual Keyboard Mode
=====================
Start                   - Enter key. Also exits virtual keyboard mode

                          by the button in the corresponding position. The 2 top characters are chosen by the
                          triggers.
Analog                  - Moves in a direction (left/right/up/down) (Useful to keep moving
                          while typing in AGI games among other things)


Image Viewer
============
For your convenience, I've included a simple image viewer in the PSP port. 
You can view anything you want while playing a game.
There are a few simple rules to follow:

- Images must be of PNG format. If you have images in another format, many 
  graphics utilities will convert them for you.
- Images must be named psp_image1.png, psp_image2.png etc. This is to make 
  sure there's no possible conflict between image files and game files.
- Images must be placed in the game directories. When using the image viewer,
  only the images of the particular game being played will be available for viewing.
- Don't place any images in the ScummVM directory, or you won't be able to see
  the images in the game directories.
- There's no guarantee that you'll be able to view your image. This is because
  big images take a lot of memory (more than the size of the image on disk). If there
  isn't enough memory left to show the image, ScummVM will tell you so. Try to make the
  image smaller by either shrinking it or reducing the colors to 256 color palette mode.

Image Viewer Controls:
=====================
Left/Right              - previous/next image (e.g. go from psp_image1.png to psp_image2.png)
Up/down                 - zoom in/out
Analog                  - move around the image
Triggers, Start:        - exit image viewer


1st Person Game Mode (Can be ignored by most users)
====================
This is a special mode built for 1st person games like Lands of Lore. If you don't have these games you can
safely ignore this mode. To enter or leave this mode, use the combo:

Right Trigger + Left Trigger + Square

Some buttons have been switched around to make these games more playable:
Square                  - Is the modifier key instead of Right Trigger.
Left/Right Trigger      - Strafe left/right
D-Pad Left/Right        - Turn left/right
Square + D-Pad          - F1/F2/F3/F4
Square + Select         - Image Viewer
Square + Start          - Esc (shows game menu)


Notes
=====
- Notice that you can switch between games! This is much faster than quitting
  and having to start ScummVM all over again. Go to the global menu and choose 'Return To Launcher'.
  (Some games may not have the Return To Launcher option available yet.)

- The PSP version of ScummVM uses the Media Engine to accelerate decoding of MP3 files. This means
  that if you have the choice of compressing using Ogg files or MP3 files, choose MP3 -- the game
  will generally run faster.

- Plugin files are NOT interchangeable between ScummVM versions! You must copy ALL the
  plugin files that come with every version of ScummVM. They sit in the /plugin
  subdirectory. If you get a crash upon startup, try deleting all the existing
  plugin files in the plugin directory and copying the new ones over again.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q:  Scummvm crashes upon starting up!
A:  See the first note above.

Q:  Pressing select doesn't make the virtual keyboard show up on screen!
A:  You need to make sure that the kbd.zip file is in the same directory as the ScummVM executable.

Q:  What do I need to run the games?
A:  A PSP that can run homebrew and the necessary datafiles for the game you want to play.

Q:  Can I run game X with this?
A:  You can find the list of supported games on the compatibility page
    at http://www.scummvm.org
    Note that ScummVM is NOT an emulator. The supported games engines have been painstakingly rewritten.
    It's not easy to add support for a game you want that currently isn't supported.

Q:  My Monkey Island 1 doesn't have any music, what gives?
A:  If your version of Monkey Island came on a CD then it has the music
    as CD Audio tracks. You need to rip those to MP3/Ogg (MP3 is preferred), naming them track1.mp3 track2.mp3
    etc. and copy them to the same directory as the game datafiles for music to work.

Q:  Game X crashes, or feature Y doesn't work. Can you fix this?
A:  Possibly.
    Because of the large amount of games ScummVM supports we obviously haven't
    played them all start-to-finish on the PSP, so it's possible there
    are bugs or issues that we're not aware of.
    When you encounter such a bug, please use the "Bug Tracker" you find linked
    on the ScummVM website, and mention all relevant info i.e. that you're
    using the PSP version, which ScummVM version it is, if the problem exists
    in a recent PC version, a detailed description of the problem,
    and if at all possible a nearby savegame. This will make it much easier
    for us to reproduce (and hopefully fix) the problem.

Building the source code
========================
To build ScummVM for PSP you need:

- ScummVM source code (svn co https://scummvm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scummvm/scummvm/trunk)

- PSP toolchain (svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/psp/trunk/psptoolchain)

- PSPSDK    (svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/psp/trunk/pspsdk)
            Note: This usually gets installed by the PSP toolchain,
            so you don't have to do it manually.

- zlib      (svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/psp/trunk/zlib)

- libPNG    (svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/psp/trunk/libpng)

- libmad(*) (svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/psp/trunk/libmad)

- libTremor(*) (svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/psp/trunk/libTremor)

(*) = optional

Once you've installed these libraries (read their README.PSP for instructions),
create a subdirectory in your ScummVM folder called 'builds/psp'. Then, in this folder, type
'../../configure --host=psp --enable-plugins --default-dynamic'. If everything is installed
correctly, ScummVM will inform you as it finds the right components. Finally type 'make' to build.
