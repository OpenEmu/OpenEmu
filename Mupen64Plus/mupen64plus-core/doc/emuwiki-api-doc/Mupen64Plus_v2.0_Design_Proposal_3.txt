== Primary Goal ==

The primary goal of this re-architecture is to split this large project into smaller projects which may proceed to be developed independently of each other.  The advantages of the new architecture are:
* The build system can be greatly simplified
* Each module can use its own build system. For example, the Qt GUI might switch to cmake for better Qt integration.
* Porting the emulator core to other platforms (namely Win32) will be greatly simplified by removing the most platform-specific pieces.
* Making releases for each package will be simpler and faster
* Mupen64Plus may be included into the Debian/Ubuntu repositories since glN64 (with its 'unknown' license) will be a separate project

== Topography ==

This re-architecture will force us to lay boundaries with well-defined APIs between different parts of the emulator.  Here are some initial suggestions for the new layout of the modules:

# Mupen64plus-core
#* To simplify porting to other platforms, the core needs to be as lean as possible
#* For this reason, the GUI interfaces, the ROM cache, and the zip/lzma/7zip decompressors will be removed
#* The core will contain the code for:
#** Emulating the R4300 main CPU and memory systems
#** Loading and configuring plugins
#** Reading, parsing, and writing all configuration files for the core + plugins
#** Parsing and returning information about ROM images
#** Core user interface for keyboard and LIRC input
#** Savestates and screenshots
#** An on-screen display
#** Cheat and debugger core functions
#** 'Dummy' plugins
# Mupen64plus-console, Mupen64plus-gtk, Mupen64plus-qt
#* Command-line only, GTK, and Qt front-end interfaces
#* Each front-end for the core library will be a separate project
#* The ROM cache code will be forked and included into both GUIs
#* The front-ends will be responsible for finding and loading the core library and the plugins
#* The dynamic library handle of the core will be passed to all the plugins, and the dynamic library handle of the plugins will be passed to the core
#* The front-ends will be responsible for loading and decompressing the ROM image, and passing a pointer to the core
# Plugins (RiceVideo, glN64, glide64, Blight Input, JTTL Audio)
#* The plugins will be spun off into separate projects
#* The plugin API will change, and will be incompatible with the old Zilmar spec

== Project Owners ==
Richard42 will retain ownership of the Mupen64plus-core and Mupen64plus-console modules.  I will recommend that Slougi take ownership of the Qt GUI.  The plugins and GTK GUI are up for grabs.
