[[Mupen64Plus v2.0 Core API v1.0|Mupen64Plus v2.0 API]]

= Mupen64Plus v2.0 Basic Core API =

Most libmupen64plus functions return an <tt>m64p_error</tt> return code, which is an enumerated type defined in [[Mupen64Plus v2.0 headers#core.h|core.h]].  Front-end code should check the return value of each call to a libmupen64plus function.

|-
|Input Parameters
|'''<tt>PluginType</tt>''' Pointer to an enumerated type to store the plugin type.  The value <tt>M64PLUGIN_CORE</tt> will always be stored.<br />
'''<tt>PluginVersion</tt>''' Pointer to an integer to store the version number of the Mupen64Plus core.  Version number 2.1.3 would be stored as 0x00020103.<br />
'''<tt>APIVersion</tt>''' Pointer to an integer to store the version number of the Core API used by the Mupen64plus core library.<br />
'''<tt>PluginNamePtr</tt>''' Pointer to a const character pointer to receive the name of the core library.  The const char * which is returned must point to a persistent string (ie, not stored on the stack).<br />
'''<tt>Capabilities</tt>''' Pointer to an integer to store a logically-or'd set of flags which specify the capabilities of the core which were built into the library during compilation.  These are defined in the <tt>m64p_core_caps</tt> enumerated type, defined in [[Mupen64Plus v2.0 headers#core.h|core.h]].
|-
|Usage
|This function retrieves version information from the core library.  This function is the same for the core library and the plugins, so that a front-end may examine all shared libraries in a directory and determine their types.  Any of the input parameters may be set to NULL and this function will succeed but won't return the corresponding information.
