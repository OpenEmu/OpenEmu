[[Mupen64Plus v2.0 Core API v1.0|Mupen64Plus v2.0 API]]

= Mupen64Plus v2.0 Core<-->Front-End API =

Most libmupen64plus functions return an <tt>m64p_error</tt> return code, which is an enumerated type defined in [[Mupen64Plus v2.0 headers#core.h|core.h]].  Front-end code should check the return value of each call to a libmupen64plus function.

'''<tt>Context</tt>''' Pointer which will be passed back to the '''<tt>DebugCallback</tt>''' function.  Can be NULL.<br />
'''<tt>DebugCallback</tt>''' Pointer to function in front-end for receiving debug information and warnings from the core.  This function must be thread-safe.  Can be NULL.  The value of <tt>level</tt> is 1 for an error, 2 for a warning, 3 for info, and 4 for verbose info.<br />
'''<tt>Context2</tt>''' Pointer which will be passed back to the '''<tt>StateCallback</tt>''' function.  Can be NULL.<br />
'''<tt>StateCallback</tt>''' Pointer to function in front-end for receiving core state change notifications.  This function must be thread-safe.  Can be NULL.
|-
|Requirements
|This function must be called before any other libmupen64plus functions.
|-
|Usage
|This function initializes libmupen64plus for use by allocating memory, creating data structures, and loading the configuration file.

This function may return <tt>M64ERR_INCOMPATIBLE</tt> if older front-end is used with newer core.

== Video Extension Functions ==
{| border="1"
|Prototype
|'''<tt>m64p_error CoreOverrideVidExt(m64p_video_extension_functions *VideoFunctionStruct);</tt>'''
|-
|Input Parameters
|'''<tt>VideoFunctionStruct</tt>''' Pointer to a structure (defined in [[Mupen64Plus v2.0 headers#vidext.h|vidext.h]]) containing pointers to the Front-end's custom Video Extension functions to override the default SDL functions
|-
|Requirements
|The Mupen64Plus library must already be initialized before calling this function.  This function cannot be called while the emulator is running.
|-
|Usage
|This function overrides the core's internal SDL-based OpenGL functions which are called from the video plugin to perform various basic tasks like opening the video window, toggling between windowed and fullscreen modes, and swapping frame buffers after a frame has been rendered.  This override functionality allows a front-end to define its own video extension functions to be used instead of the SDL functions, such as for the purpose of embedding the emulator display window inside of a Qt GUI window.  If any of the function pointers in the structure are NULL, the override function will be disabled and the core's internal SDL functions will be used.  The v2.0 core expects the <tt>Functions</tt> struct member to be equal to 9 or more.

|Usage
|This function will add a Cheat Function to a list of currently active cheats which are applied to the open ROM, and set its state to Enabled.  This function may be called before a ROM begins execution or while a ROM is currently running.  Some cheat codes must be applied before the ROM begins executing, and may not work correctly if added after the ROM begins execution.  A Cheat Function consists of a list of one or more <tt>m64p_cheat_code</tt> elements.  If a Cheat Function with the given '''<tt>CheatName</tt>''' already exists, it will be removed and the new Cheat Function will be added in its place.
