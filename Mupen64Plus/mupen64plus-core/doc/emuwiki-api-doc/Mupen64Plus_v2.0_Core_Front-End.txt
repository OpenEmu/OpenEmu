[[Mupen64Plus v2.0 Core API v1.0|Mupen64Plus v2.0 API]]

= Mupen64Plus v2.0 Core<-->Front-End API =

Most libmupen64plus functions return an <tt>m64p_error</tt> return code, which is an enumerated type defined in [[Mupen64Plus v2.0 headers#m64p_types.h|m64p_types.h]].  Front-end code should check the return value of each call to a libmupen64plus function.

== Core State Parameters ==
These core parameters may be read and/or written using the M64CMD_CORE_STATE_QUERY and M64CMD_CORE_STATE_SET commands.  The front-end application will receive a callback (via the <tt>StateCallback</tt> function pointer given to the '''<tt>CoreStartup</tt>''' function) when these parameters change value.  This callback will be sent even if the function which caused the state change was called by the front-end application itself.  Not all of these parameters are readable or writable.  Each parameter's value is held in a single 32-bit integer.  The meaning of this integer is given in the Parameter Encoding column. See the table below for details on these core parameters.

== ROM Handling Functions ==
{| border="1"
|Prototype
|'''<tt>m64p_error CoreGetRomSettings(m64p_rom_settings *RomSettings, int RomSettingsLength, int Crc1, int Crc2)</tt>'''
|-
|Input Parameters
|'''<tt>RomSettings</tt>''' Pointer to <tt>m64p_rom_settings</tt> object to be filled in with data.<br />
'''<tt>RomSettingsLength</tt>''' Size of the object pointed to by '''<tt>RomSettings</tt>''' in bytes.<br />

'''<tt>Crc2</tt>''' A 32-bit integer value containing the second CRC (taken from the ROM header) to identify the ROM.
|-
|Requirements
|The core library must already be initialized with the <tt>CoreStartup()</tt> function.  The '''<tt>RomSettings</tt>''' pointer must not be NULL.  The '''<tt>RomSettingsLength</tt>''' value must be greater than or equal to the size of the <tt>m64p_rom_settings</tt> structure.  This function does not require any ROM image to be currently open.
|-
|Usage
|This function searches through the data in the <tt>Mupen64Plus.ini</tt> file to find an entry which matches the given '''<tt>Crc1</tt>''' and '''<tt>Crc2</tt>''' hashes, and if found, fills in the '''<tt>RomSettings</tt>''' structure with the data from the <tt>Mupen64Plus.ini</tt> file.

== Video Extension Functions ==
{| border="1"
|Prototype
|'''<tt>m64p_error CoreOverrideVidExt(m64p_video_extension_functions *VideoFunctionStruct);</tt>'''
|-
|Input Parameters
|'''<tt>VideoFunctionStruct</tt>''' Pointer to a structure (defined in [[Mupen64Plus v2.0 headers#m64p_types.h|m64p_types.h]]) containing pointers to the Front-end's custom Video Extension functions to override the default SDL functions
|-
|Requirements
|The Mupen64Plus library must already be initialized before calling this function.  This function cannot be called while the emulator is running.
|-
|Usage
|This function overrides the core's internal SDL-based OpenGL functions which are called from the video plugin to perform various basic tasks like opening the video window, toggling between windowed and fullscreen modes, and swapping frame buffers after a frame has been rendered.  This override functionality allows a front-end to define its own video extension functions to be used instead of the SDL functions, such as for the purpose of embedding the emulator display window inside of a Qt GUI window.  If any of the function pointers in the structure are NULL, the override function will be disabled and the core's internal SDL functions will be used.  The v2.0 core expects the <tt>Functions</tt> struct member to be equal to 9 or more.

A Cheat Function consists of a list of one or more <tt>m64p_cheat_code</tt> elements.  If a Cheat Function with the given '''<tt>CheatName</tt>''' already exists, it will be removed and the new Cheat Function will be added in its place.
