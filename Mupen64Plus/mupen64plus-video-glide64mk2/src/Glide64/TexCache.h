// Glide64 - Glide Plugin for Nintendo 64 emulators
// Project started on December 29th, 2001

//
// To modify Glide64:
// * Write your name and (optional)email, commented by your work, so I know who did it, and so that you can find which parts you modified when it comes time to send it to me.
// * Do NOT send me the whole project or file that you modified.  Take out your modified code sections, and tell me where to put them.  If people sent the whole thing, I would have many different versions, but no idea how to combine them all.
