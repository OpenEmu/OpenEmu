SDL Audio plugin for Mupen64Plus
---------------------------------

Mupen64Plus-audio-sdl v1.99.5 - March 10, 2012
--------------------------------------------------
 - added version number to SDL-audio plugin config parameters, to support future changes
 - updated audio plugin for new Mupen64plus 2.0 API versioning scheme
 - makefile fixes and improvements

Mupen64Plus-audio-sdl v1.99.4 - November 22, 2010
--------------------------------------------------
 - Bugfix: Plugin should write default config values at startup time
 - Bugfix: fixed fast-forward for banjo-kazooie and other games which was broken due to limitation in basic resampling algorithm
 - many makefile fixes and improvements

Mupen64Plus-audio-sdl v1.99.3 - February 13, 2010
--------------------------------------------------
 - sync with core<-->plugin API change for RomOpen()
 - bugfix: logical error in previous audio refactoring causing slowdown/lockup on loading savestate or re-initializing audio
 - Makefile improvements:
   - 'sdl-config --libs' can give "-Wl,-rpath", so plugin must be linked with CC instead of LD
   - issue #257: added to makefile OS type GNU/kFreeBSD

Mupen64Plus-audio-sdl v1.99.2 - January 6, 2010
-------------------------------------------------
 - new feature: Completely re-wrote buffering/synchronization code:
   - Buffer parameters now work as advertised and all use the same units
   - Bugfix: previous defaults and algorithm behavior caused audio choppiness on slower PCs
   - Bugfix: maximum speed was previously limited to low value by constraints from primary buffer size
 - bugfix: SDL volume control will always be used on systems without OSS support
 - new feature: added MSVC8 project file, minor code refactoring to build in Windows
 - Makefile improvements:
   - throw error if OS/CPU not supported
   - use DESTDIR in install/uninstall paths
   - Allow user-specified CC/CXX/LD paths

Mupen64Plus-audio-sdl v1.99.1 - December 14, 2009
-------------------------------------------------
 - Converted to new Mupen64Plus 2.0 API
 - Code cleanup to remove non-standard data types
 - Refactored build system to separate source and object files
 - bugfix #269: jttl_audio segfaults on exit due to incorrectly ordered shutdown code

 Mupen64plus 1.5:
 +Additional SDL modulation option for volume control.
 +New Gtk GUI for plugin configuration.
 +Improved no GUI support.

 Mupen64plus 1.4:
 +Extended plugin API to allow all for runtime volume changes via OSS.

  1.4:
 +Use only standard frequency for higher compatibility
 +Fast resample algorithm (use only integers)
 +Slight improvements in buffer management : pausing audio when buffer underrun occur
 
 1.2:
 +Added possibility to swap channels
 +Some more optimizations
 +Calling RomOpen() is not required anymore. Plugin should now follow Zilmar's specs.
 +Added test functions.
 +Added support for config file

 1.1.1:
 +Fixed the bug that was causing terrible noise (thanks Law)
 +Much more debugging data appears now if DEBUG is defined
 +Few more error checks

 1.1:
 +Audio device is opened now with native byte ordering of the machine. Just
  for compatibility (thanks Flea).
 +Fixed possible double freeing bug (thanks Flea)
 +Optimizations in AiLenChanged
 +Fixed segmentation fault when changing rom.
 +Syncronization redone

 1.0.1.3:
 +Smarter versioning. No more betas.
 +More cleaning up done.
 +Buffer underrun and overflow messages appear now at stderr (if DEBUG is
  defined)
 +Many things are now precalculated (this should bring a small performance
  boost)
 +Buffer underrun bug fixed.
 +Segmentation fault when closing rom fixed (at least I think so)

 1.0 beta 2:
 +Makefile fixed to get rid of annoying warning messages
 +Cleaned up some old code
 +Default frequency set to 33600Hz (for Master Quest compatibility)
 +Better syncronization (needs some work still though)

 1.0 beta 1:
 +First public release
