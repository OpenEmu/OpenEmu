=======================================
- Cleaned and tidied up for the source release

26 JUL 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Starting program counter is fixed to lie in the 24bit zone.
	- This does not happen when 'Sonic' has been hacked.

10 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Moved all of the memory setup into mem.c, prevents any duplication.

18 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Renamed 'biosInstall' to 'bios_install'
