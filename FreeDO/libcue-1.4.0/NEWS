Changes since 1.3

* Applied most of Branden Robinson's Debian patch
  (cuetools_1.3-2.diff.gz). This included many fixes and enhancements
  to tools and manual pages. cuebreakpoints and cueconvert will exit if
  they fail on any of the input files. cuebreakpoints, cueconvert, and
  cuetools will exit with a nonzero return value if there was a failure
  on an input file.

* Added version option to all tools.

* Single quoted string support has been removed.  This was broken, and I am not
  sure of any software that supports single quoted strings in cue or toc files.

Changes since 1.2

* Build system has been rewritten using automake/autoconf.

* Added append, prepend, and split pregap modes to cuebreakpoints.

* Fixed possible compilation error with Bison.

* All tools accept long options.

* Programs exit if --input-format or --output-format is an illegal value.

Changes since 1.1

* cuebreakpoints was not printing the last track breakpoint.  This has been
  fixed.

* cueprint now prints a zero-length string for undefined values.  Flags, width,
  and precision are applied to conversion characters which have no conversion.

* Added a tagging script, cuetag.sh, which uses cueprint, vorbiscomment, and
  mp3info to tag Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files.  This needs more testing and
  documentation.

* Added a track selection flag to cueprint.

Changes since 1.0

* File formats documentation has been readded and updated (docs/formats.txt).

* ``CDTEXTFILE`` is now a recognized (but ignored) keyword.

* If only a disc or track template is specified on the command line, then only
  the disc or track information is printed, respectively.

* cueprint now supports flags and width and precision values for template
  expansion (like the printf command).

Changes since 0.6

* cuetools-1.x is a significant code rewrite of 0.x.  The cue/toc parsing code
  has been reimplemented in lex/yacc.

* cuerename has been replaced by the more general utility cueprint.

* Usage syntax of the utilities has changed.  See the respective man pages.
