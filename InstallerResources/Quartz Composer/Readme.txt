galleryNES and glitchNES are open source NES programs written by Don Miller, a.k.a. No Carrier (http://no-carrier.com).  Don has allowed and encouraged us to include them with Open Emu for the benefit of the users of our Quartz Composer plugins.  To learn how to modify the behavior and graphics of glitchNES and galleryNES, see the Readme.txt file in each folder.
