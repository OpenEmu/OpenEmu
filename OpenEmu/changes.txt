snes_ntsc Change Log
--------------------

snes_ntsc 0.2.2
---------------
- Moved configuration options to snes_ntsc_config.h, making it easier to
manage

- Greatly clarified and improved demo to read any uncompressed BMP image
and write filtered image when done

- Improved gamma to be properly applied to each RGB channel, and changed
default to compensate for difference between PC monitor and TV gamma

- Improved contrast to be properly applied to each RGB channel rather
than just luma

- Removed hue_warping for now, due to its obscurity

- Improved floating point calculations in library to be more stable and
not need double precision, which was causing problems with the sharpness
control on Windows when the DirectX libraries changed the FPU to single
precision mode

- Added extern "C" to header, allowing use in C++ without having to
rename the source file

- Made internal changes to factor out code common from all my NTSC
filter libraries, greatly simplifying things for me


snes_ntsc 0.2.1
---------------
- Significantly improved NTSC signal processing to give clearer image
and better sharpness control

- Added parameters for resolution, color bleed, and artifacts

- Added presets for composite video, S-video, RGB, and monochrome

- Halved initialization time

- Added ability to write custom blitters

- Changed interface to blitters significantly, requiring changes to your
code. They have a simpler interface and don't do any line doubling (use
a custom blitter for this).

- Added ability to change input and output pixel formats of blitters

- Improved demo with more controls and interpolation and darkening of
scanlines rather than duplicating them

- Improved documentation


snes_ntsc 0.1.1
---------------
- Changed snes_ntsc_blit() to rescale image horizontally and do line
doubling

- Added hue warping

- Changed input pixel format from 15-bit BGR to 16-bit RGB

- Fixed color speckling in solid areas


snes_ntsc 0.1.0
---------------
- First release
