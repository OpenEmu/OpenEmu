 Checks for updates, but does not display any UI unless an update is found.

 This is meant for programmatically initating a check for updates. That is,
 it will display no UI unless it actually finds an update, in which case it
 proceeds as usual.

 If automatic downloading of updates it turned on and allowed, however,
 this will invoke that behavior, and if an update is found, it will be downloaded
 in the background silently and will be prepped for installation.

 This will not find updates that the user has opted into skipping.

    This function ignores normal update schedule, ignores user preferences,
    and interrupts users with an unwanted immediate app update.

    WARNING: this function should not be used in regular apps. This function
    is a user-unfriendly hack only for very special cases, like unstable
    rapidly-changing beta builds that would not run correctly if they were
    even one day out of date.

    Instead of this function you should set `SUAutomaticallyUpdate` to `YES`,
    which will gracefully install updates when the app quits.

    For UI-less/daemon apps that aren't usually quit, instead of this function,
    you can use the delegate method
    SUUpdaterDelegate::updater:willInstallUpdateOnQuit:immediateInstallationInvocation:
    or
    SUUpdaterDelegate::updater:willInstallUpdateOnQuit:immediateInstallationBlock:
    to immediately start installation when an update was found.

    A progress dialog is shown but the user will never be prompted to read the
    release notes.

    This function will cause update to be downloaded twice if automatic updates are
    enabled.

    You may want to respond to the userDidCancelDownload delegate method in case
    the user clicks the "Cancel" button while the update is downloading.
