/*
 The following are available state inputs that a state mask is composed of:
 - Window Activity
 - Toggle State
 - Pressed State
 - Interaction State
 - Mouse State
 - Modifier State

 When all 5 state inputs are either zero's (0x0000) or ones (0xFFFF), it is considered a default state mask. When a
 looking for the most appropriate object, based a system's state, the default state mask is used if no other state mask
 could be found.
