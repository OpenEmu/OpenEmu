/*
 The theme manager is accessed using OETheme's singleton method +sharedTheme.  For example:
   [[OETheme sharedTheme] themeColorForKey:@"my color"];

 This singleton method is responsible for loading / parsing the Theme.plist file and maintaining the necessary UI
 elements to drive the application's interface.  The first call to +sharedTheme will instantiate all the necessary
 objects, therefore, it should be called as early on in the application's lifecycle as possible. If +sharedTheme fails
 to load then (in theory) the application should not be able to function.
